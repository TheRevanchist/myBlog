 <h3><a href="tensorflow.html">My first Tensorflow experiments</a></h3>
      <p> I experimented with Tensorflow in the last couple of days (hey, weekends are useful after all). My initial feeling is
      that it looks more like I am doing R coding than Python coding. You have a problem, you google the function that solves
      it, you copy paste it, and hey voila, everything works. I think that it is very easy to lose yourself on it ...

<p> On the last few months, I have been working on Stanford's cs231n course on convolutional neural networks. Needless to say,
    the course is quite amazing. I will write an article in the near future about how good is the course, and how much I 
    enjoyed it. During the course, I did a lot of coding, implementing different algorithms on neural networks. And now, it
    is the time to start using different libraries, until I finally decide which one to use for my future research.

    On this blog, I will explain what my projects are, giving opinions on different algorithms and libraries, and probably
    some other general stuff. The idea is for each github project that I do, to have some explanation on this blog. A work
    on tentative, but lets see how it goes.  </p>
