I am Ismail Elezi, a PhD student at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. My current research area is deep learning, while before I worked a bit also on graph algorithms. On this blog, I will mostly write about my current research, about general things on
machine learning and deep learning, and about the projects I am currently doing in github. The idea is to have a post on the blog for every 'big' project I will post on github and/or for every paper I will publish.
